## The first in the Classics series! A complete rewrite of the original [Uranium Mod](https://web.archive.org/web/20171014125649/https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1274100-uranium-mod-1-7-10-1-7-2-multiplayer-500k) by MinecraftForum user 'book'.

### About Classics: Uranium:
Classics: Uranium was spurned from my desire to see old, long-dead, nostalgic mods remade and brought into modern Minecraft. The original Uranium Mod is quite old and quite simple, and so I thought it a perfect choice for the first in the series.

----------

### Features:
 * Uranium Ore - Generates from -32 to 32. Be careful not to touch it or drop anything on it!
 * Nuclear Reactor - A cheaper way to create Uranium Ingots, and required to make some other irradiated items!
 * Uranium Tools & Armor - Slightly better than iron, with the enchantability of gold!
 * Mutants & Radioactive Skeletons - Beware! These new mobs are created by splashing regular Zombies and Skeletons with the new Potion of Mutation!
 * Nuclear Bombs - Massive, deadly explosion that spews Nuclear Waste everywhere!
 * Grenades - Pack TNT in a uranium shell to create a powerful throwable bomb!
 * Uranium Coal - Coal but better! Radiation gives it superpowers.

----------
### Recipes
The Nuclear Reactor Block doesn't have compatibility with J/REI yet. Its recipes are as follows:
* Gold Ingot -> Uranium Ingot
* Coal -> Uranium Coal
* Rotten Flesh -> Mutagenic Flesh
In each case, either Uranium Dust or Uranium Coal can be used as fuel. Uranium Dust is enough to irradiate 1 item, and Uranium Coal can irradiate 3.

Potion of Mutation can be brewed by adding Mutagenic Flesh to an Awkward Potion.
